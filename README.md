# Credit Score Prediction using Machine Learning

Description
Accurate credit score prediction is paramount for financial institutions in assessing creditworthiness and mitigating lending risks. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach to develop a robust credit score prediction system using a comprehensive dataset comprising 100,000 records and 28 attributes related to personal and financial information. The study investigates the intricate relationships between various factors, such as income, employment status, credit card usage, loan history, and payment behavior, and their impact on credit scores. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), logistic regression, random forest, and clustering techniques like K-means and agglomerative clustering, are evaluated to identify the most effective model for credit score prediction.

The results demonstrate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other techniques, achieving an impressive accuracy of 81.225%. This superior performance can be attributed to the ensemble nature of random forest, which effectively captures complex patterns and relationships within the dataset. Conversely, while clustering methods provide valuable insights into data structure, their predictive accuracy remains relatively lower, limiting their applicability for this specific task.

A key highlight of this study is the successful deployment of the high-performing random forest model into a user-friendly web application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and PyCharm, an integrated development environment (IDE). The deployed application seamlessly integrates the trained model, allowing users to input their personal and financial data through an intuitive interface. The application then leverages the predictive power of the random forest model to generate accurate credit score predictions in real-time.

This deployment approach not only showcases the practical applicability of the developed model but also facilitates its integration into real-world financial services workflows. Financial institutions and lenders can leverage this application to streamline credit risk assessment processes, enabling efficient and informed decision-making regarding loan approvals, credit card issuance, and other financial services.

The study underscores the potential of machine learning techniques, particularly random forest, in accurately predicting credit scores, offering a valuable tool for financial institutions to streamline credit risk assessment and enhance decision-making processes. The successful deployment of the model through a user-friendly web application further demonstrates its practical utility and paves the way for its widespread adoption in the financial sector.
